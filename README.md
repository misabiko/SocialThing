Basically a Tweetdeck-style timeline app to host feeds from various service/networks, with a slight focus on showcasing media in large quantity.

## Features
- (Quasi)-live updates, mostly through REST API
- Non-cropped images (and option for cropped too)
- Multi-column timelines
- Timeline filtering
- Timeline settings auto-saved in JSON
- Gifs and videos as straight HTML videos (With progress bar and fullscreen)
- Infinite scroll
- Autoscroll

## Why this exists
- For some reason, having more than 5 timelines is really slow on Tweetdeck
- Having to click on every image to see it full is annoying
- I'd like to keep up with multiple platforms without juggling clients
- Having an open source client you can tweak at any time is fun ðŸ˜Š

## Roadmap (the big ones at least)
- An actual release build
- Ability to post tweets
- Reply threads
- Support streaming API
- Support for Mastodon
- Graph timelines ðŸ‘€

## Known issues
- Rare mis-aligned hashtags and links
